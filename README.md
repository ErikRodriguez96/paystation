# Requirements
### The requirements for this assignment were to add a new feature to the PayStation system and modify the functionality of a previous feature
- The new feature is the **empty** method, which collects the coins out of the PayStation after a buy scenario
- The modified feature is the **cancel** method, which now utilizes a map containing the user-inserted coins  
  
*To ensure these requirements were adequately met, we wrote multiple tests as a part of our test-driven development cycle*
